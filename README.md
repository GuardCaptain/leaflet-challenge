# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, we will be creating a visualization of the earthquake data provided by the USGS (United States Geologcal Survey).

We will be using javascript and HTML to host the visualization. The data that we chose to visualize is earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 or higher.
